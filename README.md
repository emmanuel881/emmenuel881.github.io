## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

* By doing this challange i got a better understaning of flex and grid containers and cases when on is more prefered, Bootstrap card played a major role

### Continued development

* Am looking forward to deeply understand break-points in relation to bootstrap containers 

### Useful resources

- (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand card in Bootstrap for neetly packaging images and text in a container. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
